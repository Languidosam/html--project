    <h2>What is a Krabby Patty?</h2>
        <p>The Krabby Patty is more than just a fictional burger from the beloved animated series <br> 
           "SpongeBob SquarePants"; it's a central element to the show's charm and humor. <br>
            Created by Stephen Hillenburg, the Krabby Patty is the signature dish served at the Krusty Krab, a fast-food <br>
            restaurant located in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The restaurant is owned by the frugal yet <br>
            endearing Mr. Krabs, who takes great pride in the Krabby Patty and its success.
            The burger is portrayed as an <br>
            extraordinarily delicious and highly coveted item, often causing <br>
            characters to go to great lengths to obtain or protect it. Its secret formula is one of the show's most br
            enduring <br>
            mysteries, and much of the series' plot revolves around the attempts by the show's <br>
            antagonist, Plankton, to steal the secret recipe from Mr. Krabs. Plankton's schemes to acquire the <br>
            formula are typically comedic and elaborate, showcasing his desperation and the lengths he'll go <br>
            to achieve his goal.</p>

            <li>Mustard</li>
            <li>Bottom Bun</li>  
        
        <h3>FLAVOR</h3>
            <li>Seasonings: <br> -Basic seasoning usually includes salt and pepper. Additional spices and herbs can be added for extra flavor,<br>
                such as garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, or cumin.</li>
            <li>Binders: <br> -Ingredients like breadcrumbs, eggs, or oats might be used to help the patty hold its shape and enhance its texture.</li>
       <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
            <li>Forming: <br> -The ground meat or alternative is mixed with seasonings and any additional ingredients. The mixture is then shaped into round, <br>
                flat patties. The thickness and size of the patty can vary based on personal preference or recipe.</li>
            <li>Cooking: <br>- Patties are typically cooked on a grill, griddle, or skillet. They can be cooked to different levels of doneness <br>
                (rare, medium-rare, medium, medium-wezll, well-done) depending on the desired outcome.</li>
       <h3>TEXTURE</h3>
            <li>External: <br> -When cooked properly, the exterior of the patty has a browned, slightly crispy crust due to the Maillard reaction,<br>
                which adds flavor and texture.</li> 
            <li>Internal: <br> The interior texture can range from tender and juicy to firm and dry, depending on the cooking time and fat content. <br>
                For beef patties, the ideal texture is moist and flavorful without being greasy.</li>
        <h3>VARIATION</h3>

            <li>Cheeseburger Patty: <br> A beef patty with a slice of cheese melted on top during the final moments of cooking.</li>
            <li>Veggie Patty: <br> Made from vegetables, grains, and/or legumes, often seasoned and shaped similarly to a meat patty.</li>
            <li>Chicken Patty: <br> Made from ground chicken, which might include additional flavorings like herbs and spices to complement the lighter meat.</li>
